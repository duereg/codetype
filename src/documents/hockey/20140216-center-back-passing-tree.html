      In the Defensive Zone, the center back can pass to either the strong side forward or dump the puck to the wall (a theoretical pass to the strong-side back, but no one might be there).
    </p>
    <p class="header">Swimming</p>
    <p>
      The center side back should attempt to get the fuck out of the middle of the pool in front of the goal. The shortest line to a side wall is usually advised. Sometimes the path of least resistance is slightly more aggressively forward than this.

      In the midpool area, the center back has a multitude of passing options - the only person who should not be an option is the center forward (it's a trap).
    </p>
    <p>
      The center back should attempt to attack the team via the strong side of the pool. If the opposing team has overloaded that side of the pool, the center back can take the puck to the weak side forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the center back is unsure what to do with the puck, he should go to the strong side forward.
    </p>
    <p class="header">Swimming</p>
    <p>
      The center back should attempt to swim into space, favoring the strong side of the pool. The center back should not, however, swim all the way to the strong side wall - he does not want to undercut the strong side back.

      In this scenario, the main passing options for the center back are the strong side forward and the center forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the center back can pass to the weak side forward if the other team has overloaded the center of the pool and the outside is open.
    </p>
    <p class="header">Swimming</p>
    <p>
      Instead of forcing the puck to the strong-side of the pool, the back can finally start angling towards the middle of the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the back should not swim horizontally across the pool at this point. They should still keep wide and make sure they do not undercut their fellow backs. Swimming underneath the other backs is not allowed at any time.
