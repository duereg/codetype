My name is Matt Blair, born in Virginia and now I'm in the US in the Bay Area. I work in Software during the day, play underwater hockey when I get a chance, and do other things as well.

I'm the author of libraries such as [songbird](https://github.com/duereg/songbird), [laboratory](https://github.com/duereg/laboratory), [esvalidate](https://github.com/duereg/esvalidate), [grunt-extract-sourcemap](https://github.com/duereg/grunt-extract-sourcemap), and [js-algorithms](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms).
I've contributed to projects such emberjs, ember-data, browserify-middleware, fluentmigrator, amplify, and cassette.

I've also the author of the semi-decent sublime plugin [sublime-jsvalidate](https://github.com/duereg/sublime-jsvalidate).

Why a blog? I want to keep learning. I like to try new technologies. But I am a imperfect individual. I make more than my share of mistakes. As I learn from them, I hope others out there can as well. I read somewhere that a you learn more from a poor quality example or mistake than from correct ones. I don't believe this, but by that standard, my blog will be a huge success.
