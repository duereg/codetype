My name is Matt Blair, born in Virginia and now I'm in the US in the Bay Area. I work in Software during the day, play underwater hockey when I get a chance, and do other things occasionally as well.

I'm author or contributor to libraries such as laboratory, stackbone, esvalidate, js-algorithms, browserify-middleware, fluentmigrator, amplify, and cassette.

I've also author of the semi-decent sublime plugin sublime-jsvalidate.

Add a sprinkle of jQuery, Grunt, and Mongoose stuff as well.

Why a blog? I want to keep learning. I like to try new technologies. But I am a imperfect individual. I make more than my share of mistakes. As I learn from them, I hope others out there can as well. I read somewhere that a you learn more from a poor quality example or mistake than from correct ones. I don't believe this, but by that standard, my blog will be a huge success.
