My name is Matt Blair. I was born in Virginia and now I'm in the US in the Bay Area. I write code during the day, play underwater hockey when I get a chance, and do other things occasionally.

I'm the author of libraries such as [songbird](https://github.com/duereg/songbird), [laboratory](https://github.com/duereg/laboratory), [esvalidate](https://github.com/duereg/esvalidate), [grunt-extract-sourcemap](https://github.com/duereg/grunt-extract-sourcemap), and [js-algorithms](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms).

I've contributed to projects such as [emberjs](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js), [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data), [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good), browserify-middleware, fluentmigrator, amplify, and cassette.

I've also the author of the semi-decent sublime plugin [sublime-jsvalidate](https://github.com/duereg/sublime-jsvalidate) and the partially worthwhile [sublime-write-gooder](https://github.com/duereg/sublime-write-gooder).

Why a blog?

I want to keep learning. I like to try new technologies. But I am a imperfect individual. I make more than my share of mistakes. As I learn from them, I hope others out there can as well.

I read somewhere that a you learn more from a poor quality example or mistake than from correct ones. I don't believe this, but by that standard, my blog will be a success.
