# New Blog!

I've just ended a very long relationship that was hideously overdue for some closure. That's right - I've left [wordpress](http://codetype.wordpress.com).

It's a great platform if you can't make a website or just don't care about the details. But it's a little less than I was looking for.

So I've decided to get minorly techy and build a nice static site to hold all my blog entries. A thousand thanks goes to [@dreikanter](https://github.com/dreikanter/wp2md) for writing a simple converter of the wordpress XML format to markdown.

This site is so cool! It's powered by a heap of great tech:

 * [Docpad](http://docpad.org) to serve my posts
 * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) whenever I need to write code
 * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for easy styling and reactive handling
 * [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for easy blog writing
 * [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco) for cool templating
 * [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for my css
 * [Highlightjs](http://highlightjs.org/) to make my code pretty

The only thing I couldn't take with me - all the old comments. I've tried to go back and edit the old entries where the comments where useful.
