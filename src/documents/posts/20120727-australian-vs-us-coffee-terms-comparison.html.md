# Australian vs US Coffee Terms Comparison

This took me a while to figure out when I first moved to Australia. I still remember the look on the barista's face when I tried to order an Americano, and then the absolute puzzlement over what the hell a flat white vs a long black was. I hope this helps other visitors to Australia from the US order a decent cup of coffee!
