# Windows 7 - Problem Steps Recorder

Just found out about an excellent tool that ships with Windows 7. One of the hardest things about debugging software can be getting the users to document exactly what went wrong so you can test the scenario. Problem Steps Recorder - which ships with Windows 7 - records a user's actions and documents them in an easy to understand format. It even gives the user the option of sending the recording via e-mail right from the program. 

Problem Steps Recorder takes screen shots and records input, timings, comments, app versions. It outputs them in a zipped web package. Pretty cool for recording steps to reproduce a bug! To use: start > run > psr
