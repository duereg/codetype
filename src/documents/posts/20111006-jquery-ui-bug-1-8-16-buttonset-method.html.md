# jQuery UI Bug - 1.8.16, buttonset() method

I love to find bugs in good software! Came across a little jQuery UI bug today. It's for one browser, but it always excited to be able to create an easy-to-replicate bug. The bug is small - it deals with the buttonset() method.

The buttons, instead of having the rounded corners on the outside, have the rounded corners on the inside. Not critical but it made the UI I was working on look strange. If you have Chrome, and are dealing with jQuery 1.6.3 and jQuery UI 1.8.16, check out the bug here:
