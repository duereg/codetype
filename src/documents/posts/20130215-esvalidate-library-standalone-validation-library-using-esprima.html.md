# Esvalidate Library - Standalone Validation Library Using Esprima

I spent a good bit of time working on the Esvalidate code that comes with Esprima, trying to get it to work smoothly with my sublime plugin. After submitting a massive pull request to the author of Esprima and our reviewing my code we came to a conclusion - the new code was better served in its own library.

It's still in its early stages but please check out the progress I'm making here: [Esvalidate Library](http://www.github.com/esvalidate)
