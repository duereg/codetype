On Feb 9, 2011, Fat (Jacob Thornton, one of the creators on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/pull/56) to add beforeAll and afterAll statements to the [jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) library.

Pivotal, at the time, thought that they were just about to implement:

![Snapshot of a tweet where Pivotal tells @Fat that they're about to implement beforeAll and afterAll](http://cl.ly/64PF/Screen%20shot%202011-04-17%20at%2011.18.55%20PM.png)

That tweet was from December 2010.

Since then, a couple people have come up with [workarounds](https://github.com/nonplus/jasmine-beforeAll).

And now, over three years later, pivotal is about to release [beforeAll/afterAll](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/pull/56#issuecomment-56873541).

You can check out the work [here](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/commit/ba0982d89f6d2a6523e505f062638a708ac0c25e).
