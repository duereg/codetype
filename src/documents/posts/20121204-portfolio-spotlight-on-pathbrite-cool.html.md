# Portfolio Spotlight on Pathbrite = Cool?

I've recently created a [portfolio](https://pathbrite.com/portfolio/PBBvoPB0J) on [Pathbrite](https://www.pathbrite.com/). If you haven't heard of Pathbrite, they are a company aiming to:

> Collect, organize and share a lifetime of learning and achievement.

I think this section of their mission statement sums up how they are relevant to working professionals.

> ... employers rely on our Pathbrite Portfolio Platform to get a holistic view of candidates, and to better evaluate their readiness for and organizational fit to the opportunity at hand.

How does it work? The sites allows you to import data (from LinkedIn and other sites) as well as other documents (such as images and PDFs) and lay them out in whatever manner you see fit. It can also import websites you've written as well. It's a great tool for a web software developer to showcase what they're about.
