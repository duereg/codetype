# Finished the Nike+ Importer for www.runningahead.com

I finally finished up the Nike+ data importer for www.runningahead.com. The code for the importer can be checked out at my Github repository: 

<https://github.com/duereg/NikePlusImporter> 

I got a small test project up for this, which walks through everything but doesn't Mock up the calls to the Nike+ service (I couldn't be bothered). Let me know what you think.
