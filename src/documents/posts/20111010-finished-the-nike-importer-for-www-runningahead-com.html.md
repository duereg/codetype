# Finished the Nike+ Importer for www.runningahead.com

I finished up the Nike+ data importer for www.runningahead.com. You can check out the code for the importer at this Github repository:

<https://github.com/duereg/NikePlusImporter>

I got a small test project up for this. It walks through everything but doesn't Mock up the calls to the Nike+ service (I couldn't be bothered). Let me know what you think.
