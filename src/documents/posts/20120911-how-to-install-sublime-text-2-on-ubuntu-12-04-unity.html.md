# How to install Sublime Text 2 on Ubuntu 12.04 (Unity)

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) has rapidly become my favorite text editor. Cross platform, easy to use, great feature set. The Command Palette feature, where you can search for a feature without having to know where it is in the application, is an piece of usability brilliance. Somebody cobbled together a great step-by-step set of directions on how to install sublime on ubuntu. I wanted to give a shout-out to them and their work.
