A friend recently introduced me to the ideas of creating a Manager README.

The idea is that for coworkers and new team members, you give a rundown of how you like to work and what they can expect.

Some of the canonical READMEs that are frequently used as templates can be found [here](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe).

A list of the current READMEs out in the wild (including mine), as well as some links to guides to help write them, can be found [here](https://svnk.github.io/manager-READMEs/).

You can read about my management style [here](https://github.com/duereg/manager-readme).
