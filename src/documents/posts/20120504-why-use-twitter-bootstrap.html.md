# Why use Twitter Bootstrap?

I'm a huge fan of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), the simple and flexible CSS, HTML, and JavaScript user interface framework. And what's not to like? Out of the box, you'll get: 

  1. **Cross-Platform Support**
IE 7 to IPhone and everything in between (sorry IE6) 
  2. **12-Column Grid**
A good grid system takes most of the pain out of laying out your site. Getting labels, inputs, and other pieces of your ui to layout consistently and gracefully across different browsers at different resolutions can be one of the most painful parts of web development. Save yourself the work of trying to figure this stuff out on your own. The twitter kids have it under control. 
  3. **Responsive design**
One of my favorite parts. If you use the css/html correctly, as the size of your browser changes (you can see this just by resizing the browser on your desktop), the layout adapts to display the information in a consistent manner as the screen size drops. Want to hide a left nav bar if your site is viewed on a tablet? No problem. Want to hide the menu bar at the top of your site if viewed on a phone? Too easy. 
  4. **Baked In Best Practices**
Basically, if you want to get anything out of Bootstrap, you'll have to adhere to their best practices. Following someone's best practices is better than just hacking away at your CSS. 
  5. **jQuery Plugins**
Great interactive components, built on everyone's favorite JS framework, that look and interactive fantastically with the rest of Bootstrap. 
  6. **LESS Infrastructure**
I am a huge proponent of LESS/SASS/Stylus etc. If you've never used these type of CSS frameworks, they allow you to do all sort of great software developy things with your CSS. Like set variables in one place for all the colors and sizes used by your app. Or re-use common styles in multiple places without copy and paste. Or only display certain styles if certain conditions are met.  So what are you waiting for? Check out some of the docs [here](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html) and [here](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html) to get started.
